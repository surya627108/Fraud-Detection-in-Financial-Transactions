SQL-based Fraud Detection System for Online Transactions project, highlighting key skills and achievements:

Designed and implemented a robust SQL database schema for a fraud detection system, managing 500 users and 10,000 transactions with tables for users, transactions, and flagged activities, ensuring data integrity with foreign key constraints.
Developed advanced SQL queries utilizing window functions to detect suspicious patterns, such as rapid transactions within 5 minutes, high-amount transfers, unusual locations, and unknown devices, effectively flagging potential fraud.
Generated realistic sample data with 10,000 transactions, including 500 intentionally suspicious entries, to simulate real-world scenarios and test fraud detection logic, enhancing system reliability.
Automated fraud detection by creating a stored procedure to periodically run complex queries, coupled with indexes to optimize performance, demonstrating proficiency in scalable database solutions.
